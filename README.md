# poker-specs ![CI status](https://github.com/allentiak/poker-specs/workflows/tools.deps-builder/badge.svg)


## Release Information

When released, this project will follow the version scheme `MAJOR.MINOR.COMMITS`, where `MAJOR` and `MINOR` provide some relative indication of the size of the change, but do not follow semantic versioning, and `COMMITS` is an ever-increasing counter of commits since the beginning of this repository.

In general, after release all changes will endeavor to be non-breaking (by moving to new names rather than by breaking existing names). For a more detailed rationale, please refer to [Rich Hickey's "spec-ulation Keynote"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk) from [Clojure/conj 2016](https://2016.clojure-conj.org/).

Latest release: (none yet)
